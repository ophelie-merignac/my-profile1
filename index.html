				<h2>My interests</h2>
		
					<p>
						My interests are obviously linked with my skills, as I said I am someone very creative which is why I was in school of <strong>Fine Arts</strong> during seven years and nowadays I am still developing my creative skills through communication in different areas such as the social media. Indeed, I spend a lot of time managing social media accounts but not only I am also managing people, because <strong>I am the Communication Manager</strong> of Rotaract a caritative association and also ESSEC&COM an association who promotes my school.

				<h2>Travels</h2>

					<p>
						Since I was a little girl I had the opportunity to travel a lot with my family. Thanks to that, I have discovered so many countries and cultures around the world, from Asia to America through Africa.
						Travels are very important for me because they are the reason why I am so <strong>open-minded</strong>  and comfortable with people from different cultures.
						Moreover, when I was in High School <strong>I went studying abroad</strong>  and lived in an American family and it is thanks to that trip in the United States of America that I have learned to speak English.
